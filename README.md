# MoneyTacks
## Inspiration
During this Hackathon, I wanted to make a project which anyone can use disabled or not and that is important to everyone and an idea that came to mind was money. So, I decide to create a four way project which deals with important yearly tasks that people might have related to money which makes this project very useful to them. 

## What it does
This project has four different parts to it which includes the Taxes Calculator which calculates how much you might have to pay in taxes, the Inflation Calculator which Calculates how much your inflation is for each valuable that you own, the Return On Investment Calculator, and the Payment Tracker which tracks important payments which you might be making. 

## How we built it
I built this app on repl.it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and made a blog for it on Velo by Wix.

## Challenges we ran into
When creating this, it was a challenge for me to get some of the buttons to work but it eventually did work at the end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud that I was able to make this app which is useful and has so much components to it including a blog in 1 day.

## What we learned
I learned how to make some of the calculators and some features in wix such as creating sections and labels.

## What's next for MoneyTacks
 - Create more money related calculators.
 - Chatbot
